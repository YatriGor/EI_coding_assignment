=== EXPECTED BEHAVIOR ===

- Rooms automatically turn on AC and lights when occupied (â‰¥2 people)
- Rooms automatically turn off AC and lights when unoccupied
- Bookings are tracked with start time and duration
- System prevents double-booking of rooms
- Comprehensive status reporting
- Command history and undo functionality
- Graceful error handling for invalid inputs

=== DESIGN PATTERNS DEMONSTRATED ===

1. Singleton Pattern:
   - OfficeConfiguration maintains single instance
   - Global state management

2. Observer Pattern:
   - AC and Lighting systems observe room occupancy
   - Automatic responses to occupancy changes

3. Command Pattern:
   - All operations encapsulated as commands
   - Undo functionality supported
   - Command history maintained

=== AUTO-RELEASE FEATURE ===

To test the 5-minute auto-release:
1. Book a room: block room 1 09:00 60
2. Don't add occupants (leave room unoccupied)
3. Wait 5 minutes
4. System will automatically release the booking

Note: In a real demo, you might want to reduce the timer for demonstration purposes.
